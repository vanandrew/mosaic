    """Runs executor with given number of cpus and type of executor.

    This function will create a concurrent.futures.Executor object and run the
    given function with the given arguments using the executor. If `ncpus` is
    set to 1, then the executor will be a DummyExecutor, which will run the
    function in the current thread. The `type` of executor can be set to either
    "thread" or "process", which will create a ThreadPoolExecutor or ProcessPoolExecutor,
    respectively. If `ncpus` is set to a number greater than 1, then the function
    will be run in parallel using the given number of threads or processes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ncpus : int
        Number of cpus to use. If set to 1 then the function will be run in the
        current thread. If set to a number greater than 1, then the function
        will be run in parallel using the given number of threads or processes.
    type : str
        Type of executor to use. Can be either "thread" or "process".
    fn : Callable
        Function to call. The output of the iterator will be passed as unpacked
        arguments to this function.
    iterator : Iterator
        Iterator that yields the arguments to pass to the function.
    initializer : Callable, optional
        Function to call to initialize the executor.
    post_fn : Callable, optional
        Function to call after future has been unpacked.
